# gpuRIR Database and Spectrogram Paths

This repository documents the paths and structure of the datasets generated using the **gpuRIR** simulator. These datasets include both clean and noisy speech, as well as data collected from the ARNI laboratory.

##  Database Location

The database generated by the gpuRIR simulator can be found at the following Google Drive link:
